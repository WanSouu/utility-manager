<h2>Utility Manager</h2>
<p>ðŸ”» This project are my first attempts at using Vite & React ðŸ”»</p>
<p>The idea for this project is to have a website full of utilities (like: stopwatch, notepad, alarm etc.) all in a neat place with the ability to pick which utility to show and hide at any given moment in time</p>
